 * Project Details:
 * Program: "Interdisciplinary Signal Processing for Pinoys (ISIP): Software 
 * Applications for Education (SAFE)" 
 * Project: Development of a Filipino Language Writing Tool
 * Institution: De La Salle University - Manila
 * Project Manager: Allan B. Borra
 * 
 * Filipino Stanford Part-of-Speech Tagger (FSPOST) utilizes the Stanford
 * Part-of-Speech Tagger. A Filipino tagger model was developed in order to tag
 * Filipino sentences. The model was trained using the following feature sets: 
 * left5words, distsim, prefix(6), and prefix(2,1), using the owlqn2 
 * optimization. For the tagger's delimiter, it uses the vertical bar '|' symbol. 
 * The Stanford POS Tagger can be accessed in this website: 
 * https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml and the MGNN tagset (list of 
 * POS tags) used can be accessed here: http://goo.gl/dY0qFe
 * 
 * For instructions how to use the Stanford POS Tagger and the Filipino tagger 
 * model, read through the tagger's Java documentation. 
 * Note: The tagger may also be used in other languages as seen in the Stanford 
 * POS Tagger's homepage link above.
